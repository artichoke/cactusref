//! Single-threaded reference-counting pointers. 'Rc' stands for 'Reference
//! Counted'.
//!
//! The type [`Rc<T>`][`Rc`] provides shared ownership of a value of type `T`,
//! allocated in the heap. Invoking [`clone`][clone] on [`Rc`] produces a new
//! pointer to the same allocation in the heap. When the last [`Rc`] pointer to a
//! given allocation is destroyed, the value stored in that allocation (often
//! referred to as "inner value") is also dropped.
//!
//! Shared references in Rust disallow mutation by default, and [`Rc`]
//! is no exception: you cannot generally obtain a mutable reference to
//! something inside an [`Rc`]. If you need mutability, put a [`Cell`]
//! or [`RefCell`] inside the [`Rc`]; see [an example of mutability
//! inside an `Rc`][mutability].
//!
//! [`Rc`] uses non-atomic reference counting. This means that overhead is very
//! low, but an [`Rc`] cannot be sent between threads, and consequently [`Rc`]
//! does not implement [`Send`][send]. As a result, the Rust compiler
//! will check *at compile time* that you are not sending [`Rc`]s between
//! threads. If you need multi-threaded, atomic reference counting, use
//! [`sync::Arc`][arc].
//!
//! The [`downgrade`][downgrade] method can be used to create a non-owning
//! [`Weak`] pointer. A [`Weak`] pointer can be [`upgrade`][upgrade]d
//! to an [`Rc`], but this will return [`None`] if the value stored in the allocation has
//! already been dropped. In other words, `Weak` pointers do not keep the value
//! inside the allocation alive; however, they *do* keep the allocation
//! (the backing store for the inner value) alive.
//!
//! A cycle between [`Rc`] pointers will never be deallocated. For this reason,
//! [`Weak`] is used to break cycles. For example, a tree could have strong
//! [`Rc`] pointers from parent nodes to children, and [`Weak`] pointers from
//! children back to their parents.
//!
//! `Rc<T>` automatically dereferences to `T` (via the [`Deref`] trait),
//! so you can call `T`'s methods on a value of type [`Rc<T>`][`Rc`]. To avoid name
//! clashes with `T`'s methods, the methods of [`Rc<T>`][`Rc`] itself are associated
//! functions, called using [fully qualified syntax]:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::rc::Rc;
//!
//! let my_rc = Rc::new(());
//! Rc::downgrade(&my_rc);
//! ```
//!
//! `Rc<T>`'s implementations of traits like `Clone` may also be called using
//! fully qualified syntax. Some people prefer to use fully qualified syntax,
//! while others prefer using method-call syntax.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::rc::Rc;
//!
//! let rc = Rc::new(());
//! // Method-call syntax
//! let rc2 = rc.clone();
//! // Fully qualified syntax
//! let rc3 = Rc::clone(&rc);
//! ```
//!
//! [`Weak<T>`][`Weak`] does not auto-dereference to `T`, because the inner value may have
//! already been dropped.
//!
//! # Cloning references
//!
//! Creating a new reference to the same allocation as an existing reference counted pointer
//! is done using the `Clone` trait implemented for [`Rc<T>`][`Rc`] and [`Weak<T>`][`Weak`].
//!
//! ```
//! use std::rc::Rc;
//!
//! let foo = Rc::new(vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0]);
//! // The two syntaxes below are equivalent.
//! let a = foo.clone();
//! let b = Rc::clone(&foo);
//! // a and b both point to the same memory location as foo.
//! ```
//!
//! The `Rc::clone(&from)` syntax is the most idiomatic because it conveys more explicitly
//! the meaning of the code. In the example above, this syntax makes it easier to see that
//! this code is creating a new reference rather than copying the whole content of foo.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Consider a scenario where a set of `Gadget`s are owned by a given `Owner`.
//! We want to have our `Gadget`s point to their `Owner`. We can't do this with
//! unique ownership, because more than one gadget may belong to the same
//! `Owner`. [`Rc`] allows us to share an `Owner` between multiple `Gadget`s,
//! and have the `Owner` remain allocated as long as any `Gadget` points at it.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::rc::Rc;
//!
//! struct Owner {
//!     name: String,
//!     // ...other fields
//! }
//!
//! struct Gadget {
//!     id: i32,
//!     owner: Rc<Owner>,
//!     // ...other fields
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // Create a reference-counted `Owner`.
//!     let gadget_owner: Rc<Owner> = Rc::new(
//!         Owner {
//!             name: "Gadget Man".to_string(),
//!         }
//!     );
//!
//!     // Create `Gadget`s belonging to `gadget_owner`. Cloning the `Rc<Owner>`
//!     // gives us a new pointer to the same `Owner` allocation, incrementing
//!     // the reference count in the process.
//!     let gadget1 = Gadget {
//!         id: 1,
//!         owner: Rc::clone(&gadget_owner),
//!     };
//!     let gadget2 = Gadget {
//!         id: 2,
//!         owner: Rc::clone(&gadget_owner),
//!     };
//!
//!     // Dispose of our local variable `gadget_owner`.
//!     drop(gadget_owner);
//!
//!     // Despite dropping `gadget_owner`, we're still able to print out the name
//!     // of the `Owner` of the `Gadget`s. This is because we've only dropped a
//!     // single `Rc<Owner>`, not the `Owner` it points to. As long as there are
//!     // other `Rc<Owner>` pointing at the same `Owner` allocation, it will remain
//!     // live. The field projection `gadget1.owner.name` works because
//!     // `Rc<Owner>` automatically dereferences to `Owner`.
//!     println!("Gadget {} owned by {}", gadget1.id, gadget1.owner.name);
//!     println!("Gadget {} owned by {}", gadget2.id, gadget2.owner.name);
//!
//!     // At the end of the function, `gadget1` and `gadget2` are destroyed, and
//!     // with them the last counted references to our `Owner`. Gadget Man now
//!     // gets destroyed as well.
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! If our requirements change, and we also need to be able to traverse from
//! `Owner` to `Gadget`, we will run into problems. An [`Rc`] pointer from `Owner`
//! to `Gadget` introduces a cycle. This means that their
//! reference counts can never reach 0, and the allocation will never be destroyed:
//! a memory leak. In order to get around this, we can use [`Weak`]
//! pointers.
//!
//! Rust actually makes it somewhat difficult to produce this loop in the first
//! place. In order to end up with two values that point at each other, one of
//! them needs to be mutable. This is difficult because [`Rc`] enforces
//! memory safety by only giving out shared references to the value it wraps,
//! and these don't allow direct mutation. We need to wrap the part of the
//! value we wish to mutate in a [`RefCell`], which provides *interior
//! mutability*: a method to achieve mutability through a shared reference.
//! [`RefCell`] enforces Rust's borrowing rules at runtime.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::rc::Rc;
//! use std::rc::Weak;
//! use std::cell::RefCell;
//!
//! struct Owner {
//!     name: String,
//!     gadgets: RefCell<Vec<Weak<Gadget>>>,
//!     // ...other fields
//! }
//!
//! struct Gadget {
//!     id: i32,
//!     owner: Rc<Owner>,
//!     // ...other fields
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // Create a reference-counted `Owner`. Note that we've put the `Owner`'s
//!     // vector of `Gadget`s inside a `RefCell` so that we can mutate it through
//!     // a shared reference.
//!     let gadget_owner: Rc<Owner> = Rc::new(
//!         Owner {
//!             name: "Gadget Man".to_string(),
//!             gadgets: RefCell::new(vec![]),
//!         }
//!     );
//!
//!     // Create `Gadget`s belonging to `gadget_owner`, as before.
//!     let gadget1 = Rc::new(
//!         Gadget {
//!             id: 1,
//!             owner: Rc::clone(&gadget_owner),
//!         }
//!     );
//!     let gadget2 = Rc::new(
//!         Gadget {
//!             id: 2,
//!             owner: Rc::clone(&gadget_owner),
//!         }
//!     );
//!
//!     // Add the `Gadget`s to their `Owner`.
//!     {
//!         let mut gadgets = gadget_owner.gadgets.borrow_mut();
//!         gadgets.push(Rc::downgrade(&gadget1));
//!         gadgets.push(Rc::downgrade(&gadget2));
//!
//!         // `RefCell` dynamic borrow ends here.
//!     }
//!

//!         // guarantee the allocation still exists, we need to call
