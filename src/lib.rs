//! # ðŸŒµ `CactusRef`
//!
//! Single-threaded, cycle-aware, reference-counting pointers. 'Rc' stands
//! for 'Reference Counted'.
//!
//! The type [`Rc<T>`][`Rc`] provides shared ownership of a value of type `T`,
//! allocated in the heap. Invoking [`clone`](Clone::clone) on [`Rc`] produces a
//! new pointer to the same value in the heap. When the last externally
//! reachable [`Rc`] pointer to a given value is destroyed, the pointed-to value
//! is also destroyed.
//!
//! `Rc` can **detect and deallocate cycles** of `Rc`s through the use of
//! [`Adoptable`]. Cycle detection is a zero-cost abstraction.
//!
//! ðŸŒŒ `CactusRef` depends on _several_ unstable Rust features and can only be
//! built on nightly. `CactusRef` implements `std::rc`'s pinning APIs which
//! requires at least Rust 1.33.0.
//!
//! ## `CactusRef` vs. `std::rc`
//!
//! The `Rc` in `CactusRef` is derived from [`std::rc::Rc`] and `CactusRef`
//! implements most of the API from `std`.
//!
//! `cactusref::Rc` does not implement the following APIs that are present on
//! [`rc::Rc`](std::rc::Rc):
//!
//! - [`std::rc::Rc::downcast`](std::rc::Rc::downcast)
//! - [`CoerceUnsized`](core::ops::CoerceUnsized)
//! - [`DispatchFromDyn`](core::ops::DispatchFromDyn)
//!
//! If you do not depend on these APIs, `cactusref` is a drop-in replacement for
//! [`std::rc`].
//!
//! ## Cycle Detection
//!
//! `Rc` implements [`Adoptable`] to log bookkeeping entries for strong
//! ownership links to other `Rc`s that may form a cycle. The ownership links
//! tracked by these bookkeeping entries form an object graph of reachable
//! `Rc`s. On `drop`, `Rc` uses these entries to conduct a reachability trace
//! of the object graph to determine if it is part of an _orphaned cycle_. An
//! orphaned cycle is a cycle where the only strong references to all nodes in
//! the cycle come from other nodes in the cycle.
//!
//! Cycle detection is a zero-cost abstraction. If you never
//! `use cactusref::Adoptable;`, `Drop` uses the same implementation as
//! `std::rc::Rc` (and leaks in the same way as `std::rc::Rc` if you form a
//! cycle of strong references). The only costs you pay are the memory costs of
//! an empty
//! [`RefCell`](std::cell::RefCell)`<`[`HashSet`](std::collections::HashSet)`<T>>`
//! for tracking adoptions and an if statement to check if this structure is
//! empty on `drop`.
//!
//! Cycle detection uses breadth-first search for traversing the object graph.
//! The algorithm supports arbitrarily large object graphs and will not overflow
//! the stack during the reachability trace.
